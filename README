Notification system for albums and concerts.
Written in Perl 6.
Very much a work in progress.

=====
To run it, set up a postgresql-9.2 database called 'soonish-dev' with role
'soonish-dev' on localhost. Put the password in your ~/.pgpass file
and in the SOONISH_DB_PASSWORD environment variable.

You need to have the latest version of DBIish installed.

Then run

    $ ./db < schema.sql
    $ perl6 t.pl

There isn't more to it yet :(
